> **Bot:** Your warm soup with mulled wine is being prepared.  

Example 2 of Conversation

## üîó Integrated Data Sources

1. OpenWeather API (for weather-based meal suggestions)  
Why? Provides real-time weather data to help suggest suitable meals.  
Endpoint: https://openweathermap.org/api

2. Spoonacular API (for recipe recommendations)  
Why? Enables searching for recipes based on user-provided ingredients.  
Endpoint: https://spoonacular.com/food-api

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Handling missing user input (e.g., missing food type) | Added slot handling and prompts to request missing details. |
| API failures (e.g., weather API down) | Implemented error handling with fallback messages. |
| No information in API (e.g., no weather info for a specific city) | An error message is returned. |
| Ensuring natural conversation flow | Used Rasa's rules and stories to guide interactions smoothly. |

## Dialog Policy Experimentation (Bonus)

### Modifications & Rationale
- Added rules for greeting responses to ensure the bot always acknowledges the user before and after a task.  
- Modified action to handle weather in 4 different cases to dynamically suggest meals based on weather.  
Cold weather (<15¬∞C): Suggests warm food and hot drinks.  
Mild weather (15-20¬∞C): Suggests comfort food and refreshing drinks.  
Warm weather (20-30¬∞C): Suggests light food and cold drinks.  
Hot weather (>30¬∞C): Suggests cooling food and frozen drinks.  
- Added new food order phrases: Various phrases like "I need food," "I am starving," "I want to order food," etc. were added to recognize the user's intent to order food. 

### Observed Results & Insights
- More engaging interactions with personalized recommendations.  
- Users appreciated the answer to "Thank you" sentences, such as "Happy to help".  
- Variety of food order phrases: The bot now recognizes several different ways users ask for food, such as:  
"I need food"  
"I am starving"  
"I want to order food" etc.
Users are no longer limited to just one phrase to request food, which enhances the natural flow of conversation and improves user experience.  

## üì¢ Future Improvements
1. Adding payment processing for food orders.
2. Expanding recipe database for nutrient information (e.g. calories, proteins, fat etc.).
3. Adding expected preparation time of the meal.

## üìå Conclusion

This chatbot successfully demonstrates a task-oriented dialog system with real-world data integrations. 
It enhances user experience by dynamically responding to food orders, weather inquiries, and recipe searches.
